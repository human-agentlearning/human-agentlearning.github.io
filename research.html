                        <p align="justify">
                        A core area of my research is sequential decision making under uncertainty with resource constraints.
                        More precisely, I am interested in multi-armed bandit (MAB) models where pulling an arm (i.e., making a decision) requires a cost and the total spending is limited by a finite budget.
                        To tackle this problem, I have introduced a new model, called the budget-limited MAB, and have also proposed a number of arm pulling algorithms for which I have provided both theoretical and empirical performance analyses.

                        My other core research area is algorithmic game theory. I work on large coalition formation games from both game theoretical and decision making perspective.
                        In more detail, I look at systems where the number of participants is very large (typically thousands or more). Within these systems, calculating different solution concepts (e.g., the core, nucleolus, Shapley-value, etc.) are very hard. Given this, my goal is to identify approximation techniques that can efficiently provide high quality results.
                        To do so, with some of my colleagues, we have introduced a novel, vector-based, representation model of the participating agents, with which we can calculate the abovementioned concepts in a significantly more efficient way. 
                        For more details, see our IJCAI 2013 <a href="http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/351024/">paper</a> (collaboration with Tri-Dung Nguyen from School of Maths, Southampton).

                        Staying within game theory, I also study different games with resource allocation from both aspects of classical and behaviourial game theory.
                        In particular, I am interested in calculating different equilibria and price of anarchy.
                        A <a href="http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/272649/">preliminary version</a> of work has been published at SAGT 2011. 
                        Within the repeated games setting, I aim to identify players' favourite resource allocation strategies when they repeatedly play such games against different opponents (e.g., Repeated Colonel Blotto, repeated Dollar Auctions).

                        More recently, I have been working on security games, where the Stackelberg model and its variants is used to model the game between defenders and attackers.
                        In this model the defender is allowed to make the first move, and the attacker will reveal their best response in the second phase.   
                        Within this setting, I investigate the following research questions:
                        <ul>
                        	<li align="justify"><i>What happens if the game is repeatedly played, and the defender has no prior information about the attackers?</i> 
                        	    Our results on zero-sum security games (joint work with Haifeng Xu) can be found <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Playing-Repeated-Security-Games-with-No-Prior-Xu-Tran-Thanh/5f97238612bea789463858f2ba316d352fbe92c6">here</a> (AAMAS 2016),
                        		and this <a href="https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/411950/">work</a> (in collaboration with Qinyu Guo from NTU) looks at the network games setting (IJCAI 2017).
                        	</li>
                        	<li align="justify"><i>What happens if the attacker can lie about their true utilities by faking the observation of the defender?</i>
                        		Our ACM EC 2019 <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3328526.3329629">paper</a> and NeurIPS 2019 <a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/9037-manipulating-a-learning-defender-and-ways-to-counteract">paper</a> (both with Jiarui Gan from Oxford) investigates this problem in more detail, and we provide optimal deception solutions for the attacker to fool their opponent.
                        	</li>
                        	<li align="justify"><i>Vice versa, how a defender incentivise the attacker to follow a certain desired behaviour that will be beneficial for the system?</i> 
                        		For the single shot game setting, our IJCAI 2018 <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01987">paper</a> provides some insights (joint work with Fei Fang's group from CMU).
                        		While for the repeated setting, we have some working papers that look at <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.11727">last round convergence guarantees</a> and payoff matrix design approaches that guarantee a single unique Nash equilibrium point. The idea is that once we can establish these properties (i.e., unique Nash and last round convergence guarantees), we can guide the opponent to converge to a favourable mixed strategy.

                        Another application domain of my research is crowdsourcing. In particular, I am interested in investigating the performance of different crowdsourcing systems from a theoretical perspective, aiming to provide rigorous performance guarantees for task allocation algorithms.

                        I am heavily involved in the research work on home energy management.
                        In particular, we aim to improve the energy consumption profile of home owners, in order to reduce the CO2 emission of the domestic energy sector. 
                        To do so, as the first step, we mainly focussed on the accurate learning and prediction of homeowners' habit, such as appliance usage and heating preferences.

                        More recently we look at combining ML techniques with user preference elicitation to further improve predictive home energy management. 
                        However, the preference elicitation part has to be done without annoying the users too much (e.g., to learn when to ask and when not to ask questions). Our results can be found at:

                        <i>The cost of interference to closed evolving systems:</i> We investigate what is the cost to interfere into closed systems, if we want the system to achieve some desirable states.
                        As a first step, we look at evolving evolutionay games, where an external decision maker can invest his resources into the system (e.g., via a reward scheme) such that in the long term, the agents will follow a prefered behaviour.

                        <i>Stochastic shortest path problems:</i> This is an ongoing work on approximating the classical stochastic shortest path, defined by Frank (1969).
                        In particular, so far I have developed a new concentration inequality that provides a lower bound on the probability mass of the lower-tail (i.e., a lower bound on the probability P(X < a) with a < E[X]).
                        Combining this new result with other existing concentration bounds, I could provide a O(n^3) running time algorithm that can achieve O(1/n) approximation for sure (where n is the number of vertices).
                        In addition, the algorithm works for any type of bounded distribution.
                        To the best of my knowledge (which can be obsolete), the scurrent tate of the art is pseudo-polynomial with 2/n approximation coefficent, which only works on discrete distributions.
                        Currently I am aiming to improve the approximation coefficient of my algorithm.
